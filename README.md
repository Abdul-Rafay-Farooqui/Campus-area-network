# Campus Area Network (CAN) Project  

This repository contains a detailed simulation of a **Campus Area Network (CAN)** designed using Cisco Packet Tracer. The project demonstrates a network topology suitable for a campus environment, showcasing the implementation of core networking concepts.  

## Project Overview  

The **Campus Area Network** project includes:  
- A well-structured network topology simulating a campus environment.  
- Proper configuration of routers, switches, and end devices.  
- Implementation of VLANs, subnets, and other advanced network protocols to ensure efficient data flow and segmentation.  
- A focus on scalability, security, and reliability within a campus setting.  

This project serves as a practical example for students, educators, and professionals learning about network design and management.  

## Features  

- **VLAN Segmentation**: Organized network segments for improved traffic management.  
- **Subnetting**: Optimized IP allocation across devices.  
- **Routing Protocols**: Configured to ensure seamless inter-network communication.  
- **Scalable Design**: Suitable for a growing campus environment.  
- **Comprehensive Device Configuration**: Includes switch and router settings to ensure proper functionality.
